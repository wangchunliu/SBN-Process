Parallel Meaning Bank 4.0.0
============================


Introduction
------------

The Parallel Meaning Bank (PMB) is a parallel corpus of sentences and short texts
with formal semantic annotations for four languages: English, German, Dutch
and Italian. The meaning representations are based on Discourse Representation
Theory (DRT), and combine logical with lexical approaches to linguistic meaning.
The representations comprise:

* logical symbols (boolean operators and comparison operators)
* non-logical symbols (WordNet synsets and VerbNet roles)

Following DRT, we call the meaning representations Discourse Representation
Structures (DRSs). The DRSs are provided in the familiar box-like format, in 
clause format, and in simplified box notation (SBN). The flat clause format is used
for evaluation purposes and also contains alignment with the words of the input
sentence. In contrast to DRT, we adopt a neo-Davidsonian analysis of events,
using the thematic roles of VerbNet as relations between individual entities,
and the synsets of WordNet to denote individual concepts.

Data Statement
------------
This data set can be characterised as follows. The meta data of each document gives
information about the source. There is a high gender imbalance: there are approximately
twice as many male as female named entities. The documents in the gold part are on average
shorter than in the silver part of the corpus. Some of the texts might contain offensive
language. The current release comprises examples that are certainly not representative for 
the entire corpus. This is because of the way they were selected: not randomly, but on the 
basis of quality of the semantic analysis. Nevertheless, this selection contains a diverse 
set of semantic phenomena, including: quantification, negation, modal operators, scope, 
tense, and referring expressions.

About this release
----------------

This release is a frozen snapshot of a subset of PMB documents that are marked as gold,
silver or bronze standard in the current development version. The gold folder contains all
documents that are fully manually checked, while the silver contains documents
that are only partially manually checked. Bronze documents do not have any manual
annotations. WARNING: use silver and bronze documents at your own risk!

The current development version itself is made available via a wiki-like Web interface
called PMB Explorer. Semantic annotation is a very hard task and despite thorough manual
checking can still contain mistakes. If you find any errors in the annotation, you can
either let us know (via the website) or, if you feel sure, you can correct them yourself,
and thus contribute directly to the PMB. To do so or get more information about the
project, visit http://pmb.let.rug.nl

Directory Layout
----------------

The PMB is partitioned into 100 parts. Each part is identified by a
two-digit number. A part contains up to 10,000 documents. Within a part,
each document is identified by a four-digit number. The ID of a
document consists of the part number, followed by a slash, followed by
the document number, e.g. 00/0030.

File Formats
------------

Every document directory contains several files with the raw texts and resulting analyses.
They are all encoded in UTF-8 with Unix-style line endings. Each file starts with a
two-letter language identifier (ISO-639-1).

 *.met       Meta data about the document, such as language, title, data, source, genre, and
             subcorpus. The format is one key: value pair per line.

 *.raw       The raw text of the document. The standoff annotation (see below) refers to
             character offsets (not byte offsets) within this document.
 
 *.status    Contains eight rows, indicating the status (gold, silver, bronze) of each
             tagging layer (tok, sem, sym, cat, sns, rol). For gold documents the
             status is gold for each layer, for silver there can be differences. You can
             have a more detailed look at the tagging layers here:
             http://pmb.let.rug.nl/explorer/explore.php

 *.tok.off   Standoff tokenization annotation in a vertical format. It contains one word
             token per line. Columns are separated by one space character. They contain,
             respectively:
                1. the character offset of the start of the token;
                2. the character offset of the end of the token;
                3. a token ID, consisting of the number of the token within the sentence;
                   (last three digits) and the number of the sentence within the
                   text (all other digits);
                4. the token itself.

 *.tok.iob   Tokenization in IOB format. It contains one character per line. Columns are
             separated by one space character. They contain, respectively:
                1. the Unicode code point of the character in decimal notation;
                2. a character tag: T (start of word token), S (start of sentence),
                   I (inside token) and O (outside token).

 *.parse.tags Contains the CCG-style derivations

 *.drs.xml   Contains the Discourse Representation Structure (DRS) representing the meaning
             of the text. The formalism used is Discourse Representation Theory (DRT),
             extended to use neo-Davidsonian events with roles from VerbNet and concepts
             from WordNet.

 *.drs.clf   Contains the DRS in clause notation, with word alignments. This is the file
             type that is used to calculate semantic similarity between DRSs.
 
 *.drs.sbn   Contains the same DRS in simplified box notation.         

Semantic Parsing
------------

For people interested in semantic parsing, we added a script (src/extract.sh) to help
with automatically creating train/dev/splits. It will create the recommended splits for 
each language, storing them in exp_data/. It creates a *.txt.raw file containing the raw 
sentences, and a *.txt and *.txt.sbn file that contains all the DRSs in clause or SBN 
format, separated by a white line.

Simply run the following command from the main release directory:

    ./src/extract.sh

Note that this script might take some time. Likely, for your purposes it makes more sense
to download the data directly from here: https://pmb.let.rug.nl/releases/exp_data_4.0.0.zip

The train/dev/split is created on part-level and differs per language:

    en:
        train - everything not in part X0 or X1
        dev   - parts [0-4]0 (p00, p10, p20, p30, p40)
        test  - parts X1 (i.e. p01, p11, p21, etc)
        eval -  parts [5-9]0 (p50, p60, p70, p80, p90)
    de:
        train - everything not in X0, X1 and X2
        dev   - parts X0
        test  - parts X1 and X2
    it:
        train - X5, X6, X7, X8 and X9
        dev   - parts X0 and X1
        test  - parts X2, X3 and X4
    nl:
        train - X6, X7, X8 and X9
        dev   - parts X0 and X1
        test  - parts X2, X3, X4 and X5

Note that these are our suggested splits, to make comparing approaches easier, but you are
free to create different splits if they fit your own needs better.

For English, we also add an evaluation set, which is an extended version of the held out test set
that was used in the first shared task on DRS Parsing (Abzianidze et al. 2020 - 
https://aclanthology.org/W19-1201.pdf). We ask you treat this set as a leaderboard set: please
only evaluate your final model on this set (i.e. one score per paper). See pmb.let.rug.nl for 
the leaderboard scores of previous models. If you forward us your score, we will include it!

Layer Extraction
----------
We provide a script that can extract token-level annotations with desired statuses. For
example, it is possible to obtain all gold standard semantic tags, to train a semantic
tagging model. Moreover, the script also allows you to include information of other layers,
which can be filtered according to their status (gold/silver bronze).

The extracted data is formatted similarly to the CoNLL-U format. The first column is always
for tokens; the rest of the columns can be changed according to your preference. Raw sentences
and document IDs are included as comments. One needs to provide a file path for a json file
that records document ids, available translations and their annotation statuses. Train, dev
and test splits are based on a regex for part numbers.

Usage:

Extract gold standard data for English semantic tagging and split it into
train, dev, and test parts (according to the official PMB recommendation):

    python src/extract_conll.py en PMB_DATA_DIR DIR_FOR_SPLIT_FILES -j statuses.json -ls tok:g sem:g

Extract silver standard data for English semantic tagging that will be used only
for training (therefore, all the data is collected in a single file 'train_silver'):

    python src/extract_conll.py en PMB_DATA_DIR DIR_FOR_SPLIT_FILES -j statuses.json -ls tok:g sem:s -sp train_silver:..

Extract gold standard data for German semantic role labeling, append it with
additional annotation layers, like CCG categories, semantic tags, and symbols of
at least silver annotation status and split it into recommended train, dev, and test parts:

    python src/extract_conll.py de PMB_DATA_DIR DIR_FOR_SPLIT_FILES -j statuses.json -ls tok:g rol:g cat:gs sem:gs sym:gs -sp dev:.0 test:.[1-2] train:.[3-9]

Disclaimer
----------
The creators and annotators of the PMB do not necessarily share all views found in the text.
Indeed, some of the views in the texts of the PMB might be offensive to readers.
We do think including such texts from the corpus is beneficial for researchers working on hate-speech.
